A reailer offers a reward program to its customers, awarding points based on each recorded purchase.
a customer recieves 2 points for every dollar spent over $100 in each transaction, plus 1 point for 
every dollar spect between $50 and $100 in each transaction. 
(e.g. a $120 purchase = 2x$20 + 1 x $50 = 90 points).
Given a record of every transaction during a three month period, calculate the reward points earned 
for each  customer per month and total.
